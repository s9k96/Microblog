                <h4>Quora Question-Pairs Similarity: </h4>
                <p>Over 100 million people visit Quora every month, so it's no surprise that many people ask similarly worded questions. Multiple questions with the same intent can cause seekers to spend more time finding the best answer to their question, and make writers feel they need to answer multiple versions of the same question. Quora values canonical questions because they provide a better experience to active seekers and writers, and offer more value to both of these groups in the long term.
                Task is to build a probilistic model to check if two questions have same intent so that Quora can mark them as similar Questions to improve user experience.
